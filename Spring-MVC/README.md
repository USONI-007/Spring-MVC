-----
Problem Statement
In this course, you have learnt about software engineering topics ranging from version control to extreme programming, as well as backend development using Spring Boot, JPA, and PostgreSQL to build a backend application.

 

In this assignment, you’ll apply everything you have learnt  to build an image hoster similar to Imgur, one of the top 100 most visited websites in the world.

 

Goals of This Assignment 

Through working on the image uploader, you’ll get a chance to experience what it is like to join an engineering team as a new, junior software engineer. Specifically, you’ll get a chance to familiarize yourself with the codebase by fixing a few bugs in the codebase. You’ll also get a chance to implement a few well-defined features to the image uploader and improve its functionalities.

Lastly, this project will also introduce you to new concepts to Spring MVC, JPA, PostgreSQL and unit testing. Some of these concepts will be explained to you, and some concepts, you need to Google and Stack Overflow to learn those concepts on your own. This experience will further enhance the experience of joining a new team as a junior software developer as mentioned above.
